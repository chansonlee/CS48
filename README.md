# CS48
News Aggregator Webapp in Ruby


System Requirements-
Ruby version- 2.5.1
Rails version- 5.2.0.

You'll probably want to run 'bundle install'.... This installs the necessary gems for rails.

Steps to run project on MacOS:
1. Clone the repository
2. In a terminal go into the repository CS48-master
3. Go into onehitwonder folder (cd onehitwonder)
4. Start the server (bin/rails server)
5. Go to localhost:3000 in a browser
6. Now you should see our webapp displaying trending posts from techcrunch, youtube, usatoday, and reddit.

You can also see the webapp by just going to this link: http://onehitwondercs48.herokuapp.com/
As of now it shows a list of Twitter posts, followed by Techchrunch posts, then YouTube posts, then USAToday posts, then Reddit posts. Soon we'll be organizing them in more interesting ways but our goal was just to merge our sites into one at this point.
